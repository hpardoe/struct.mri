Miscellaneous scripts for analysis of structural MRI data

hp_ant_post_wmhypo.sh
A script for measuring the anterior-posterior distribution of the freesurfer white matter hypointensity label. I used to it to measure the distribution of heterotopic GM nodules in people with periventricular nodular heterotopia, providing quantitative evidence that these nodules are mainly posterior. This is set up to run on my computer which runs linux so fsl commands are all prefixed with "fsl5.0-"

load.mgh.R
loads Freesurfer mgh files into R

save.mgh.R 
saves mgh files from R
